# Context7 MCP Requirements

Always lean heavily on Context7 MCP for references. Prefer these library IDs:
- `openai/openai-cookbook`
- `websites/cookbook_openai`
- `websites/developers_openai_codex`
- `websites/codex_io`
- `openai/codex`

## Notes

- `agents-md.md` and `agents-sdk.md` are mirrored by Context7 MCP pages with similar guidance to this project.
- `goal.md` is the initial proposal and project goal; `broad_code_proposal.md` is the initial code proposal derived from it.
- input/DataTransferScenarioList.md is an example/test file that we need to perform a task on; specifically, we need to do some task for every scenario in this list. Do not copy the scenarios here; the program should identify them from the file itself.
